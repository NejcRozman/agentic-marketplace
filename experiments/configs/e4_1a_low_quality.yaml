# E4.1a: Intentional Low Quality - Byzantine Robustness Test
# Research Question: RQ4 - Byzantine Robustness
# Description: 1 adversarial provider (11%) delivering hardcoded low-quality responses vs 8 honest providers

experiment:
  id: "e4_1a_low_quality"
  name: "Intentional Low Quality (11% attackers)"
  description: |
    Tests reputation system's ability to detect and penalize adversarial provider
    delivering intentionally low-quality service (hardcoded responses, no LLM).
    1 Byzantine provider vs 8 honest providers over 50 auctions.
